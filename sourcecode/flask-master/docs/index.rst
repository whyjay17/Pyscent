Welcome to Flask's documentation. Get started with :ref:`installation`
and then get an overview with the :ref:`quickstart`. There is also a
more detailed :ref:`tutorial` that shows how to create a small but
complete application with Flask. Common patterns are described in the
:ref:`patterns` section. The rest of the docs describe each component of
Flask in detail, with a full reference in the :ref:`api` section.

Flask depends on the `Jinja`_ template engine and the `Werkzeug`_ WSGI
toolkit. The documentation for these libraries can be found at:

- `Jinja documentation <http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs>`_
- `Werkzeug documentation <http://werkzeug.pocoo.org/docs>`_
