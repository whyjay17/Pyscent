# CS527 Project
## Project Idea
### Problem Definition
- Detect code smells in Python code
- Find common security issues in Python code
- Survey different candidates of python code analysis tools to see which types of code smells are addressed with tools available
- Compute various metrics from the Python source code
- Help enforce coding standard for Python
- Add additional code smell features to the existing open source tool
- Develop a wrapper tool which summarizes metrics for code smells based on the output of different types of existing tools
- Provide analysis of code smells through data visualization
